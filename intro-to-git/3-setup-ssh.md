# Setting up SSH on your computer
Now that you've got the git bash (a.k.a git shell) installed, we need to setup a way to securely communicate with GitHub. This is an important step, but may be foreign to folks not familiar with running commands from a terminal.

SSH stands for Secure Shell - it's a protocol that allows you to remotely connect to servers and services (GitHub in this case). By enabling your machine to use SSH, you remove the need to supply a username and password everytime you connect to GitHub.

Fortunately, the folks at GitHub have already put together instructions for setting up SSH. To get up and running, start [here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)

To successfully make it through the instructions, you will need to already have a GitHub account and have the git bash installed on your machine.

*Hint*: Notice that each set of instructions contains a link under the header that allows you to specify which operating system you are using.

Once you've run through these instructions, you'll be ready to move on to the [next lesson]().
