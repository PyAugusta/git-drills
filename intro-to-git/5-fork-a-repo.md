# Forking a repository
This part is super easy...in fact, you can fork this project from this very page!

Look in the upper-right hand corner of the page. You should see a button that says "Fork". Click it and a copy of this repositroy will be added to your account.

That's it, you've forked a project!

Visit the [next lesson](6-clone-a-repo.md) to learn how to download the project using the git shell.
