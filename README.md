# git-drills
## Welcome to PyAugusta's git drills repository!
This repository is intended to serve as a place for members of the community to be introduced to the awesome capabilities of git and practice contributing to open source projects.

Since we are PyAugusta, all the code you'll see here will be Python (or Python-centric at least), but that does not in any way mean that git is only for Python. Explore some of the awesome projects on git and you'll see what I mean.

With that said, don't be intimidated. Anyone can learn to use git (and Python too)!

If you're brand new to this, start by checking out the [intro-to-git](https://github.com/PyAugusta/git-drills/tree/master/intro-to-git) folder. There, you'll find step by step instructions on how to set up a free account, fork a repository (this one in fact), and contribute to it.

If you've done this before, check out the Issues. If you're feeling froggy, fork, solve, and submit a pull request!
